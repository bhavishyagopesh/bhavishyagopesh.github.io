 This post is based on our (Kuldeep and yours truly ) paper submitted in TACAS2019 and is currently a work in progress.

  Prelude: What is (approximate) Model Counting?1 Given a Boolean formula, say $ \phi $, to to compute the number of solutions of $ \phi $ is called (Exact) Model Counting. But it turns out it&amp;rsquo;s NP-hard ( Actual it&amp;rsquo;s #P, which is a class of counting problems associated with decision problems, and therefore is harder than NP-complete problems because counting the solutions is definitely harder than identifying one ).</description>
