### About me

I am a Computer Science (C.S.E) Freshman at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur,India.There is great tradition of FOSS at my college and which motivated me to pursue open-source development, and finally leading to G-SoC. It seems to me that I might do open source ,probably ,for my whole life.And GSoC could be my first big opportunity.The idea that code written by me could be a part of industry(and hence could reach to so many users),simply, intrigues me.
